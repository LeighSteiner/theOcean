# The Ocean

*Just Fall The Fuck In...Love*

The Ocean is for connecting slowly in the age of light speed. 
The Ocean is for connecting deeply in the era of fast-food love. 

The Ocean is the antidote to endless swipe-rights, and freedom from infinite questions and answers.
The Ocean is life beyond the superficial, beyond the petty, beyond the small.

The Ocean only asks you one question: do you have something to say? 


## how to swim 

You just have to jump in -- there's no long profile to fill out, because who you are changes from day to day, person to person.  There are two ways to get started: 

1.  Blow a bubble.  If your next great adventure is waiting out there for you, what is the first thing you would want to say to them?  Write that message, and drop it in the ocean.  Your person will find it -- or someone you never even imagined.  Maybe a dozen someones.  But you only get to pick one match per bubble: choose wisely. 

2. Start a stream -- or try to.  Go diving in the ocean, find the message that was written just for you.  Write a beautiful second message, and maybe the human you're speaking to will pick you to speak back to.
